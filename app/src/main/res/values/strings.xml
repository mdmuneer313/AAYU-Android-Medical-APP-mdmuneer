    <string name="Introduction">
        Usually many lives are lost due to the time taken for shifting a patient from one hospital to another hospital because of lack of necessary equipment. The existing systems do not provide any information about the availability of equipment of all the hospitals present. There are individual systems of hospitals that show the information about their specific hospital.
    </string>
    <string name="conclusion">
        Present health care system doesnâ€™t not consist of any medium to know all the information of different hospitals. We have conducted a survey and found that it is required by the people to know information about different hospitals and the equipment present in them so that they can choose appropriate hospital for treatments. It also helps in getting information of medicines and steps to follow in emergency situations.
